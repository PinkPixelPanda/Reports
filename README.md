[Strategic Trends in DoD SBIR Funding (2015–2025)](DoDSBIRFunding_Perez.pdf)  
An empirical analysis of Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding from 2015–2025. Methods include descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, time series analysis, and regression forecasting. Findings highlight how the DoD balances broad experimentation with deeper investments in high-impact areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and aerospace.

[Profiling Diabetes Readmission Data: An Exploratory Analysis](ProfilingDiabetesReadmissionData_EDA.pdf)  
An exploratory data analysis of a hospital admissions dataset for patients with diabetes. The report profiles 100,000+ encounters across U.S. hospitals and examines variable types, missingness, skewness, and coding quality. Findings highlight both the dataset’s teaching value in demonstrating messy real-world clinical data and its limitations for modern predictive modeling:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

[Time and Duration Distributions in Urban Bike Ride Data](DistributionsinUrbanBikeRideData_Perez.pdf)  
An analysis of ride-sharing data focusing on the distribution of start times and trip durations. Visualizations reveal strong skewness and long-tailed patterns that averages conceal. The study shows peak-hour activity concentrated between 16:00 and 18:00, ride durations clustered under 15 minutes, and longer weekend trips extending the tails. Results emphasize how weekday rides align with short, utilitarian commutes while weekends reflect more leisure-oriented usage.
