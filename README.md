[Strategic Trends in DoD SBIR Funding (2015–2025)](DoDSBIRFunding_Perez.pdf)  
An empirical analysis of Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding from 2015–2025. Methods include descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, time series analysis, and regression forecasting. Findings highlight how the DoD balances broad experimentation with deeper investments in high-impact areas such as AI, cybersecurity, and aerospace.

[Profiling Diabetes Readmission Data: An Exploratory Analysis](ProfilingDiabetesReadmissionData_EDA.pdf)  
An exploratory data analysis of a hospital admissions dataset for patients with diabetes. The report profiles 100,000+ encounters across U.S. hospitals and examines variable types, missingness, skewness, and coding quality. Findings highlight both the dataset’s teaching value in demonstrating messy real-world clinical data and its limitations for modern predictive modeling.

[Time and Duration Distributions in Urban Bike Ride Data](Distributions%20in%20Urban%20Bike%20Ride%20Data%20_Perez.pdf)  
An analysis of ride-sharing data focusing on the distribution of start times and trip durations. Visualizations reveal strong skewness and long-tailed patterns that averages conceal. The study shows peak-hour activity concentrated between 16:00 and 18:00, ride durations clustered under 15 minutes, and longer weekend trips extending the tails. Results emphasize how weekday rides align with short, utilitarian commutes while weekends reflect more leisure-oriented usage.

[Predictive Analytics in Retail: A CRISP-DM Action Plan](PredictiveAnalyticsRetailPlan1_Perez.pdf)  
A structured action plan applying the CRISP-DM framework to predictive analytics in retail. The report outlines how data scientists, engineers, analysts, and managers collaborate to turn sales, loyalty, and digital storefront data into actionable forecasts. It emphasizes business understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment while addressing bias, transparency, and customer trust. The plan shows how predictive analytics improves forecasting, strengthens inventory control, and enhances customer experience.
