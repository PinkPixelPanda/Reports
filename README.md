- [Strategic Trends in DoD SBIR Funding (2015–2025)](DoDSBIRFunding_Perez.pdf)  
  An empirical analysis of Department of Defense Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) funding across 2015–2025.
  The study applies descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, time series analysis,
  and regression forecasting to evaluate funding across domains such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,
  aerospace, and infrastructure. Results show how the DoD balances broad experimentation
  with concentrated investment in high-impact areas, offering insight into future defense innovation priorities.
